                Kyoto Products FOSS License Exception
                      Version 1.0, 9 March 2011

This Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception allows
developers of FOSS applications to include Kyoto Products with their FOSS
applications.  Kyoto Products are licensed pursuant to version 3 (or later)
of the GNU General Public License ("GPL"), but this exception permits
distribution of Kyoto Products with a developer's FOSS applications licensed
under the terms of another FOSS license listed below, even though such other
FOSS license may be incompatible with the GPL.

The following terms and conditions describe the circumstances under which
this FOSS License Exception applies.

              FOSS License Exception Terms and Conditions

1. Definitions

    "Derivative Work" means a derivative work, as defined under applicable
    copyright law, formed entirely from the Program and one or more FOSS
    Applications.

    "FOSS Application" means a free and open source software application
    distributed subject to a license listed in the section below titled
    "FOSS License List."

    "FOSS Notice" means a notice placed by FAL Labs in a copy of the Kyoto
    Products Libraries stating that such copy of the Kyoto Products
    Libraries may be distributed under FAL Lab's or Kyoto Products' FOSS
    License Exception.

    "Independent Work" means portions of the Derivative Work that are not
    derived from the Program and can reasonably be considered independent
    and separate works.

    "Program" means a copy of FAL Labs' Kyoto Products Libraries that
    contains a FOSS Notice.

2. A FOSS application developer ("you" or "your") may distribute a Derivative
   Work provided that you and the Derivative Work meet all of the following
   conditions:

   a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all portions
      (including modifications) of the Program included in the Derivative
      Work (provided that this condition does not apply to Independent Works);

   b. You distribute Independent Works subject to a license listed in the
      section below titled "FOSS License List";

   c. You distribute Independent Works in object code or executable form
      with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the
      same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object
      code or executable forms;

   d. All works that are aggregated with the Program or the Derivative Work
      on a medium or volume of storage are not derivative works of the
      Program, Derivative Work or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be
      considered independent and separate works.

3. FAL Labs reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms and
   onditions.  If all of the above conditions are not met, then this FOSS
   License Exception does not apply to you or your Derivative Work.
